        <h2>3. Eligibility & Registration</h2>
        <p>To use the Platform, you must be at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into binding
            contracts under Kenyan law. By registering, you represent and warrant that all information you provide is
            accurate, current, and complete.</p>
        <h3>3.1 Pharmacist Registration</h3>
        <p>Pharmacist Tenants must hold a valid license issued by the <strong>Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB)</strong>
            of Kenya. Upon registration, pharmacists must submit their PPB license number, certificate of registration,
            and proof of professional indemnity insurance. MediHub reserves the right to verify all credentials and may
            reject or suspend any application that fails verification.</p>
        <h3>3.2 Patient Registration</h3>
        <p>Patients may register using a valid email address and must provide accurate personal information. Patients
            purchasing prescription medications must provide valid prescriptions from licensed healthcare professionals
            registered with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council.</p>

        <h2>4. Pharmaceutical Regulations Compliance</h2>
        <div class="sp-callout">All pharmaceutical transactions conducted through MediHub are subject to the Pharmacy
            and Poisons Act (Cap 244), the Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Board regulations, and applicable international
            pharmaceutical standards including Good Distribution Practice (GDP) guidelines.</div>
        <h3>4.1 Prescription Medications</h3>
        <p>Prescription medications shall only be dispensed upon presentation and verification of a valid prescription.
            Each prescription must include: the patient's full name and date of birth, the prescriber's name,
            qualification, and registration number, the medication name (generic or brand), dosage, quantity, and
            directions for use, and the date of issuance. Prescriptions for controlled substances under the Narcotic
            Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act are subject to additional verification requirements.</p>
        <h3>4.2 Controlled Substances</h3>
        <p>The Platform strictly regulates the sale of controlled substances in accordance with the Narcotic Drugs and
            Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act, 1994. Schedule I substances are prohibited from sale on the Platform.
            Schedule II-V substances require enhanced verification, including prescriber confirmation and patient
            identification.</p>
        <h3>4.3 Drug Recalls & Safety Alerts</h3>
        <p>MediHub will promptly communicate any drug recalls or safety alerts issued by the PPB, WHO, or FDA.
            Pharmacist Tenants are required to immediately remove recalled products from their storefronts and cooperate
            with recall procedures.</p>

        <h2>5. Orders, Payments & Refunds</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Order Processing</h3>
        <p>All orders are processed by the specific Pharmacist Tenant from whom the product is purchased. MediHub acts
            as a marketplace facilitator and does not directly dispense, handle, or ship pharmaceutical products. Order
            confirmation is subject to product availability, prescription verification (where applicable), and
            successful payment processing.</p>
        <h3>5.2 Pricing</h3>
        <p>Product prices are set by individual Pharmacist Tenants. MediHub does not control or guarantee pricing. All
            prices are displayed in Kenyan Shillings (KSh) and include applicable taxes unless otherwise stated. MediHub
            charges a platform commission of up to 5% on each transaction.</p>
        <h3>5.3 Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>Due to the nature of pharmaceutical products and health regulations, refunds are subject to the following
            conditions: unopened, non-prescription products may be returned within 7 days of delivery; prescription
            medications cannot be returned once dispensed except in cases of dispensing error; cold-chain products
            (e.g., insulin, vaccines) cannot be returned due to storage integrity concerns.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Protection & Privacy</h2>
        <p>MediHub processes personal data in accordance with the <strong>Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019</strong> and
            our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. Health-related personal data is classified as
            sensitive personal data and is subject to enhanced protection measures including encryption at rest and in
            transit, access controls, and audit logging.</p>

        <h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms shall first be subject to mediation under the Mediation Act, 2012 of
            Kenya. If mediation fails, disputes shall be resolved by arbitration in Nairobi in accordance with the
            Arbitration Act, 1995. The language of arbitration shall be English, and the decision of the arbitrator
            shall be final and binding.</p>
